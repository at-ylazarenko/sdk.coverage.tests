# ruby coverege tests

To run the tests successfully we required few tools (instruction for the installation could be found on the tools websites)
1. ruby  https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
2. node js https://nodejs.org/en/
3. yarn https://yarnpkg.com/

Steps to run the tests for the first time
1. run command `yarn install` // install JS dependencies
2. open ruby directory
3. run command `bundle install` // install ruby dependencies
4. run command `yarn ruby:test` // command which generates and run tests

If the dependencies haven't changed to generate and run the tests only the last step needed
